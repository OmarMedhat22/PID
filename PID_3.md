# Paramater Tunning


I tuned the parameter manually as I set kd = -0.8 and Kp = -0.3 and I did not change Ki as I noticed that if I change it the car go off  the road.


so my advice we should tune kp first increase it untill no change happen in the simulator then we tune ki if the the results was very weired leave it and put it is value = 0 and go to kd to tune it increase it untill you see good results in the simulator.I think Kd will be greater than Kp.
